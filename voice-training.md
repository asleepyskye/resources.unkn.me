# Voice Training Resources

Voice training is focused on two main goals:
1. Developing a voice that is authentically yours.
2. Making that voice your default, natural way of speaking.

## Important Guidelines
- **Avoid Pain**: If any technique or resource is causing throat pain, stop immediately, rest your voice, and ensure you're performing the exercises correctly. Voice training should not hurt if done properly, except for some fatigue from increased voice usage.
- **Healing and Care**: If your throat feels sore:
  - Give it time to rest.
  - Use **SOVTs** (Semi-Occluded Vocal Tract Exercises). Learn more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gE8kg__NU).
  - Stay **hydrated**! Drink water regularly, and remember it takes 40â€“80 minutes for water to hydrate your throat.
- **Explore Different Approaches**: If one method or coach doesn't work for you, try another. Voice training methods vary, and finding the right fit can be a process.
