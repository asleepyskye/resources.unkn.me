# Chimpo's Voice Training Resources and General Guide

The goal of this voice training guide is such.
1. Developing a voice that is authentically yours.
2. Making that voice your default, natural way of speaking.

Although this guide is primarily for voice feminization, I will also make notes of resources for resources on voice masculinization. These will work for voice androgynization as well.

## Important Guidelines
- **Avoid Pain**: If any technique or resource is causing throat pain, stop immediately, rest your voice, and ensure you're performing the exercises correctly. Voice training should not hurt if done properly, except for some fatigue from increased voice usage.
- **Healing and Care**: If your throat feels sore:
  - Give it time to rest.
  - Use **SOVTs** (Semi-Occluded Vocal Tract Exercises). Learn more in my [Soon to come] section of the site dedicated to exercises, or [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gE8kg__NU).
  - Stay **hydrated**! Drink water regularly, and remember it takes 40â€“80 minutes for water to hydrate your throat.
- **Explore Different Approaches**: If one method or coach doesn't work for you, try another. Voice training methods vary, and finding the right fit can be a process.

3. **Deepstealth**  
  - Although I haven't reviewed all the videos, I've heard this channel be highly recommended by others - Feminization only
   - Channel: [Deepstealth](https://www.youtube.com/user/deepstealth/videos)  

4. **Olivia Flanigan**  
  - Same situation as Deepstealth, I haven't watched many of the videos, just know people that like them
   - Channel: [Olivia Flanigan](https://www.youtube.com/@oliviaflanigan5938)  

5. **TransVoiceLessons**  
  - Large note for this channel. This channel is generally the first people come across on YouTube when looking up "Trans Voice Training MTF". It is also the most commonly watched as such, and the "Heat from Fire, Fire from Heat" meme mostly comes from this channel. That being said, the introductory videos are often a bit higher level than works for most people. It covers a lot of good content, and *is* incredibly informative, however, lots of the videos are too high of bar for entry for most.
   - Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@TransVoiceLessons

- **Other User Guides**  
  - [Transgender Teen Survival Guide on Tumblr](https://transgenderteensurvivalguide.com/post/165875705735/transfeminine-voice-the-links-below-have-a-little)
   - For both masculinization and feminization
  - [LS Voice Training Guide (Level 1) on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/d3clhe/ls_voice_training_guide_level_1_for_mtf/)  
    - Note: A thorough guide, though somewhat verbose. *Skip the "hold on the swallow" exercise*, as it can harm your throat.
- **Comprehensive Paper Guides**  
  - [Voice Training Papers on Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/ST9pr)

- **Resonance and Pitch Tools**  
  - [Acoustic Gender Tool](https://acousticgender.space/)

### Voice Lessons
  - Depending on your situation, there are ways to do in person or online voice lessons. If you are able to go this route, it can be significantly more effective, as being able to see what your throat is doing, as well as the instant feedback can be monumental for helping some people with voice training. It can also provide motivation. To find these, look up online for transgender voice therapists or coaches in your area.
  - One of the places I can highly recommend people go to for *free* group voice lessons is the VRChat Trans Academy. They host one or two voice training sessions per week, all open to the public. They are done either on Discord, or in VRChat. The sessions hosted in VRChat are often streamed to Twitch as well if you'd prefer watching there.

### Vocal Surgeries
  - Depending on your situation, it might make sense to opt for vocal surgeries. I do not have much information on this, and I strongly suggest trying other routes *before* going for surgery. Not only are vocal surgeries a quite risky procedure with severe consequences if the surgery is not successful, other routes can give you valuable skills for even if you do end up opting for surgery, such as cadence.
