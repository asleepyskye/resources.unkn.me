# Exercises and Practice Techniques

This is still a Work-In-Progress as I type more and more of this guide up! Feel free to message me with any feedback you may have in discord @chimpo_ .


Note about exercises! They are incredibly helpful time to time, but once you get decent at the exercise, it should *not* be something you have to do over and over and over again. They are mostly one and done, tools to help find your voice. Once you get a hold of the exercise, practice what you can using the end result consistently, and bring it into your average speaking habits. [Here is a good video by TransVoiceLessons on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOdsHDOPTbY)

This resource is meant to be a database for many different exercises and vocal practices in which if you feel one way isn’t working for you, or if you feel like you need to go back and work on expanding your envelope to your goals a little bit more, you can. Generally you should not try to maximize it to the extremes, as it goes wayyy past what sounds normal to a person, and can end up sounding forced and unpleasant if done in that manner.
