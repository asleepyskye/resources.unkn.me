## Voice Feminization Guide
## Voice Masculinization Guide

Vocal Androgenization note below.

## Introduction


The goal is to provide a foundation to allow you to be able to practice voice training, as well as having resources to seek out individual practices
This is a generalized guide which is a culmination of my experience with others, my viewing of other guides, and the classes I’ve taken for vocal production and technique. Other people’s guides online are fantastic too! If you find another one works better for you, amazing. That’s why I love listing other guides on the resources page.
What qualifies me to give this guide? I’m a licensed music teacher with background education with vocal production and vocal techniques. With this background, combined with experience doing voice training myself, as well as helping others voice train is what gives me my background in this. Of course I didn’t develop this all by myself. All the rough guidelines are based on lots of different guides, videos, and more. I’m picking and choosing how I present all of this in a matter that I find works best for myself and my students.

## These are guidelines!

One major thing to note with this is I am setting this up to give you the fundamentals on being able to shape your voice however you please. That being said, everyone is going to be starting at different points, everyone is going to be aiming at different goals. As you develop your voice, if you find that on an exercise, it seems incredibly easy, you can audibly hear the difference being made, and/or find that you personally don’t desire the change that it causes- You have my full permission to move on to the next thing! Please! Shape these exercises to match you! If you find that you’re getting stuck later on, not getting quite there, feel free to go back to earlier exercises, see if you can push them that little bit further to help there!

## Vocal Androgyny

You may notice that there is not a dedicated vocal androgyny guide on here. The reason for that is because vocal androgyny is done in two ways. One is having some aspects of the voice be heavily masculine, while other parts of the voice be heavily feminine. The other way of sounding androgynous with your voice is to have the aspects of your voice lie in the middle range of the spectrum. In either case, how you get to that sound is by learning how to do the opposite of where your voice lies naturally. If your voice naturally lies more feminine, learning how to make your voice more masculine will allow you to learn how to do an androgynous voice. The techniques for masculinization, feminization and androgenization are all roughly the same, just done in opposite directions, so you’ll be able to use the techniques you learn to androgynous sounding voices as well.

## Habits for a Successful Voice Trainer

Voice training is hard.

Really.

Most of that difficulty often doesn’t come in the actual exercises however. What makes voice training so darn hard is just starting it, and keeping that habit up. As you go through this, here are some tips for starting and maintaining successful voice training!

The biggest tip I have is don’t treat voice training like an activity you do once in a while for long sessions. Although sometimes doing that can be great, remember that nearly all of these exercises can be done in a manner where you practice for 5 minutes, and then an hour later do another 5 minutes, etc. Setting up your mental idea of what practice can be is important for successful habit building.

Another tip to make voice training much easier is to treat it like any other habit building. Tie it with something else you do regularly. Remove barriers that stop you from starting with ease. Schedule it if you need to! Anything to make it so you can build a successful habit of doing voice training building.

## Assistance from others while voice training

Help while voice training helps significantly! Just where and how to ask for help may be unknown for many. Here are some tips I will give for that! First off, record yourself. Record yourself frequently. Even if you don’t feel like you can listen to it right at the moment, it will help you compare later on! I understand it’s so scary to do so though.

The next place I highly recommend going to is either friends who have done voice training, or in online trans communities (Both on /r/voicetraining, or discord servers) – Although I don’t want to give any specific communities, try finding discord servers revolving around online trans content creators, such as artists or youtubers. These often have dedicated voice training channels where you can get feedback! The one exception to the rule I made about giving specific communities, check out the VRChat group Trans Academy, and their discord. They have specific public voice training sessions where they can help you wherever you are in your voice training progress.

By far the best place still will be an actual in person voice therapist. Look up online for ones around you, join your local trans community, and ask around there! 

## What if you don’t have a safe space to practice?

There are still things you can actively do to improve your future skills with voice training right now! Many skills can be practiced in a way that can be done stealthily. Here are some tips for ways to do so! [More tips will come too!]
- Practice listening for the different aspects of voice
- Find vocal goals, and describe what you like about the voice, what you don’t like.
- Practice these techniques by practicing character imitations! So many cartoon characters use the same principles that are used for voice training. Sounding like Yogi Bear, Patrick Star, and many more characters actually helps a ton!
