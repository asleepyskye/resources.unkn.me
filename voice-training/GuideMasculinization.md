# Voice Masculinization


This is still a Work-In-Progress as I type more and more of this guide up! Feel free to message me with any feedback you may have in discord @chimpo_ .


Here are a couple introduction videos on the process before getting into it!

## Find your goal
One of the most fluid goals I give every one of my students at the very start of voice training is to FIND VOICES YOU LIKE. It doesn’t need to be your ultimate goal, it just has to have elements in it that you enjoy. With these voices, try to actively describe what you like and don’t like about the voice. If you would like to at this stage, practice with this differentiating aspects of voice using a video like [this]()

## Vocal Health, and Breathing

An element I want to talk about before going into the techniques themselves is to talk about the health of your voice, and how to throughout this process keep relaxed throughout.

Voice training is intensive. You’re using muscles you likely haven’t used much, and it puts strain on them. If you feel it hurting, stop. It could be just fatigue of the muscles, pushing too much in too little time, or it could be that you’re doing something wrong. There will always be future practice, so don’t worry about over exerting yourself at the instant moment, and try to pace it so you do these over time, slowly building more and more of that muscle up.

Although you are using new muscles, and building them, your voice shouldn’t sound strained while doing so. There are multiple reasons that could happen, but we want this voice to be as easy to use as possible, generally speaking, and to do that you should work on being relaxed as much as you can while doing exercises. If you hear tightness in your voice, unless specifically trying to be, chances are you might need to take a step back to make sure you are doing it correctly, or if something else is creeping in the way stopping you. One easy way to help significantly with this is to make sure that you are able to provide enough good solid breath support for your voice. There are two main sets of muscles that you can think of when breathing. You have your chest/rib muscles, and you have the diaphragm, being the larger down low muscle for breathing. When tight and stressed, it’s easy to want to purely use your rib muscles, but doing so will make your entire voice sound tight. Try breathing with a large “O” syllable, breathing as low as possible, breathing out in a manner that feels just as open to that too. It will help significantly both allow you to do more with your voice, as well as sounding more relaxed and more natural.

**Note for the next 3 topics** – There are two ways of starting voice training. Some start with the Larynx, others start with vocal weight and pitch. Moving the larynx will make the biggest and quickest impact with students, while talking about pitch and weight is the most tangible for many students without much background with vocal production. I will start with talking about the Larynx, as it overall requires the most amount of work, but absolutely feel free to move onto pitch and vocal weight while you’re working on the larynx! Doing that often helps progress out of the ruts that you may be in.

Just remember. You don’t have to be perfect to move onto the next step. Understanding the idea, and identifying the feeling of the change/what muscles are changing are what is important; getting it to be perfect can come later over time and practice.


### Larynx Height/Vocal Tract Length
Once mastered, arguably the biggest impact that you can make to your voice to have it sound more masculine or more feminine is your vocal tract length. The main means that we use to change that is to move your body’s larynx (also known as the voice box). Your body has all the muscles required to move this up and down already, but it requires the most work to be able to consistently have it moved for long periods of time.

A fantastic way of feeling this move up and down is with a yawn, as well as a swallow exercise. NOTE: Do not hold the swallow if you try moving it up with this exercise. It can seriously hurt and wear down muscles if held. Thankfully for masculinization generally we are lowering the larynx, so it isn’t required as much to think about.

Once you can feel what you are moving, follow the siren exercises in one of these videos.

Some other exercises to continue helping isolate this are these.

I have more listed in my exercise database if you feel like these aren’t working, and you want different approaches to it.

### Vocal Weight

Vocal weight is the strength of the main pitch of your voice. Other ways of thinking about it are how “buzzy” your voice is (More buzzy is heavier), strong voice compared to calmer voice, or light voice compared to a heavy voice. These all generally refer to the same thing with our voice.


When doing these exercises, it may be easy to want to sound “breathy” with our voice, which is where we have excess air in our voice, or starting with too much air.

### Pitch


Pitch is often what people think of right away for “differences between a feminine voice and a masculine voice”- and to some extent it makes a huge difference, just not in how you think it does. That being said, it is something that we will want to control in our voice as we go further, and learning how to isolate it and vary our pitch without strain is key to getting a natural sounding voice.

### Bringing these all together

There isn’t one thing that makes a voice sound masculine or feminine on its own. They impact each other in different ways, and all combine to provide a voice that sounds traditionally feminine or traditionally masculine.

### Prosody

One of the biggest factors with our voice that changes dramatically how we sound is prosody. Prosody to summarize is basically the flow of how we speak, with where we put stress, the intonation of our voice with our pitch, where in the sentence we put our stress, and more.

One aspect about prosody is that it can often be language and culture dependent, so take what I say here with a pinch of salt, as the specifics will change with what language you put it into, and what dialect you put it into. 

The main difference to pay attention to is whether the pitch of your voice is throughout the sentence. Typically masculine voices vary much less in pitch, with just a slight downwards slope in pitch as the sentence goes on. Feminine voices vary much more, bouncing in pitch significantly. 

There’s a lot more varying factors that you should mess around with, find what you like and don’t like. Try messing with the length of your vowels, elongating certain aspects of your voice. Try changing how fast or slow you typically speak, and if varying it works for you.

### “Brightness” and voice articulations

Alongside your vocal tract length, there's other ways to affect the resonance of your voice, with that change, one of the key ways to change it is by varying the brightness of your overall voice, and the brightness of individual vowels. Brightness is how prominent the non “base” pitch of your sound is, with darker sounds being more of the base tone, brighter having more of the upper frequencies. The main way to change this is to change the size of your mouth, and the position of your tongue.

---

### The Soft Palate, pharynx, and throat size

One often overlooked way to change the throat is the size of your throat and nasality of your voice.

The soft palate is what can cover the opening of your nasal passage in the back of your mouth, and also majorly shapes the back of the throat

The pharynx is a muscle that changes the size of your pharyngeal wall in the back of your mouth.

### Other elements that can be added

There are some other elements that people add to their voice to get it how they want, especially in specific contexts

A common method added to voices to help with projecting voices is “Vocal Twang”. Here is a video about it, mostly for voice acting, but applicable here too. [New York Vocal Coaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLVrYKmwvc)

### Where to next?

You’ve gotten to the end of all the exercises I provide. Where to next? Well, it all depends what you want to do! You can continue exploring your voice, messing around in different ways to try finding more and more ways to push your envelope.

The main thing however with what you should do is USE YOUR VOICE. Use your new voice until it becomes the default voice, where you don’t have to think about it at all. If you want to vary your voice a lot, keep doing different voices that push your envelope. The muscles get harder to use if you don’t practice using them, so just keep using them! Try continuously polishing individual parts of your voice. You may find at this point specific vowels or consonants you don’t like, well keep trying to change those specific elements. Share your voice, and get feedback from others! Although you are your own worst critic, it’s still amazing to share your voice with other people! Learn new skills- lots of what I teach here are directly able to learn other vocal skills, such as voice acting, or singing. Singing is definitely its own beast, but you can continue trying to expand it in that way.
